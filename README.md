How to install it:
=

     1. Clone this repository using your git GUI program of choice or the "git clone [URL]" command from the command line inside the directory you want to clone the project into (where [URL] is the H.T.T.P.S. U.R.L. of this project found on the project main page near the bottom-right in a box). I recommend cloning this repository into a directory on your computer where you can find all of your other projects, e.g. into a folder named "myArtemis" in your Eclipse or NetBeans workspace. 
     2. Open this as a project with your I.D.E. of choice. You may need to refresh your I.D.E.'s navigator or somehow add the project to your project list within the I.D.E.; how to do this may vary. (In Eclipse, refreshing the Navigator panel should be sufficient if you put the project in its own folder in your Eclipse workspace).
     
     3. Use your I.D.E. to export the project as a .jar file to your "plugins" folder in your CraftBukkit testing area. Be sure to include the plugin.yml file and the source code only.
     
     4. Run your local CraftBukkit test server and it should work!
